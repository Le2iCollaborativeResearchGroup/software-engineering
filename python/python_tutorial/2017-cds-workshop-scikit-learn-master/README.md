# Scikit-learn Tutorial

This repository contains notebooks and other files associated with my
[Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org) tutorial.

This tutorial is strongly inspired from
the
[Jake van der Plas tutorial](https://github.com/jakevdp/sklearn_pycon2015) at
Pycon 2015 and
the
[Scipy 2016 tutorial](https://github.com/amueller/scipy-2016-sklearn).

## Installation Notes
This tutorial requires the following packages:

- Python version 2.7 or 3.5+
- `numpy` version 1.6 or later: http://www.numpy.org/
- `scipy` version 0.9 or later: http://www.scipy.org/
- `matplotlib` version 1.3 or later: http://matplotlib.org/
- `scikit-learn` version 0.18 or later: http://scikit-learn.org
- `ipython` version 3.0 or later, with notebook support: http://ipython.org

The easiest way to get these is to use the [conda](https://store.continuum.io/) environment manager.
I suggest downloading and installing [miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html).

Once this is installed, the following command will install all required packages in your Python environment:
```
$ conda install numpy scipy matplotlib scikit-learn ipython-notebook seaborn
```

Alternatively, you can download and install the (very large) Anaconda software distribution, found at https://store.continuum.io/.

## Downloading the Tutorial Materials
I would highly recommend using git, not only for this tutorial, but for the
general betterment of your life.  Once git is installed, you can clone the
material in this tutorial by using the git address shown above:

    git clone https://github.com/lesteve/2017-cds-workshop-scikit-learn

If you can't or don't want to install git, there is a link above to download
the contents of this repository as a zip file.  I may make minor changes to
the repository in the days before the tutorial, however, so cloning the
repository is a much better option.
